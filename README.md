This research work had attempted to look into the techniques of unsupervised text document clustering by enriching text features using encyclopedic knowledge with word embedding technology. Throughout this study the basic elements of the model for text document clustering are presented. The designed system consists of document preprocessing module (tokenization, normalization, stop-word removal and stemming) that is essential for better extraction. Structuring encyclopedic knowledge module, consists of representations of categorical concepts and the tree like linked representation of these concepts. Feature extraction extracts representative features relevant to the original text sets, so as to reduce the dimensionality of feature vector spaces. This module includes relating text documents with encyclopedic knowledge and finding the representative features of the text (categorical concepts, related categorical concepts). Learning word embedding (word2vec) vector representation of text document captures the distributional representations of words. The contextual terms of the related concept features are extracted using neural word embedding technique, word2vec.
